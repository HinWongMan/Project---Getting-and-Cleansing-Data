unzip the zip file.

Set the directory with both "train" and "test" directory as working directory and run the R script.

The R script combined the training set and test set, lookup the activity using the activity label number, and change the names into a more user friendlier form. At last it summarise the means grouped by activity and subject, and create a txt
 file of the tidied dataset
