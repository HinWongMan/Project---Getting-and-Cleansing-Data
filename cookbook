Below stated blocks of word of data label. The meaning of the data is composed using the blocks.
For example, “tBodyAccelerometerMeanOfZ” is the mean of the mean time domain signal captured by Z-axis Accelerometer. “fBodyGyroscopeJerkSignalMagitudeStandardDeviation” is the standard deviation of magnitude of Jerk signal calculated using the Euclidean norm

tBody
	Time domain signal captured by meters

fBody
	Body signal undergone Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

Accelerometer
	Body signal captured by Accelerometer at a constant rate pf 50 Hz, filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.

Gyroscope
	Body signal captured by Gyroscope at a constant rate pf 50 Hz, filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise.

JerkSignal
	Body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time

Mean
	Mean of the body signal

StandardDeviation
	Standard Deviation of the body signal

Magnitude
	Magnitude of the body signal calculated using the Euclidean norm

OfX/OfY/OfZ
	Signals of X/Y/Z axis
